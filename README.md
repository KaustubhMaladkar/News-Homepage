### Useful resources

-   [Stack Overflow Question on Navigation Bar Transitions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65742729/navigation-bar-transitions) - This question on Stack Overflow by [Micheal](https://stackoverflow.com/users/15008832/michael) answered by [bmdev](https://stackoverflow.com/users/14825873/bmdev) helped me implement my navigation bar transitions
-   [Easily Structure your Layout with CSS Grid's 'grid-template-areas'](https://youtu.be/qTGbWfEEnKI) - This video by [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/@DesignCourse) on YouTube helped me understand what 'grid-areas' are and how to use them. Without the knowledge of this, I would just have used multiple flex-containers
-   [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) - This chatbot created by OpenAI is more than just a chatbot. It can debug code like a pro. During the project, when I had any issue, the first thing I did was ask this thing about the issue. Even though it is not completely accurate, it certainly is useful.
